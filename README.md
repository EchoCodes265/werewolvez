# Werewolvez

## Description

Werewolvez is a web-based game application inspired by the classic social deduction game, Werewolf (or Mafia). Players are assigned secret roles, with some working as "werewolves" trying to eliminate other players, while the rest try to identify and remove the werewolves from the game. Each game progresses through alternating "day" and "night" phases, where players engage in discussions, votes, and secret actions.
